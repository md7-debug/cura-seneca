# Contributing

Thank you for helping Cura grow slowly and carefully.

## Before opening a pull request

1. Open an issue for substantial design, content, or architecture changes.
2. Keep the `read → consider → write back → return` flow and the boundaries in [`DESIGN_CONTRACT.md`](DESIGN_CONTRACT.md).
3. Run `npm run build` and `npm test`.
4. Explain the content source, translation authorship, and reuse rights in the pull request.

## Add a language

1. Add interface strings to `src/i18n/copy.js` using the existing key set.
2. Add the locale’s letter content to `src/content/letter32.js`.
3. Add the locale to the language switcher in `src/App.jsx`.
4. Verify layout, accents, document language, and date formatting at desktop and mobile widths.

Future growth may move locale content into separate files; the MVP keeps it together so the schema remains obvious.

## Content standard

- Work from the public-domain Latin text and cite the edition.
- Mark quotation, fresh translation, and interpretation distinctly.
- Do not submit a modern translation unless its license clearly allows repository redistribution.
- Prefer a lucid, faithful translation over archaic imitation.
- Explain genuine interpretive uncertainty instead of smoothing it away.
